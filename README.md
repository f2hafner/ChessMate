## Description<a name="Description"></a>
ChessMate is just your standard old chess game. Well it would be, but there is a twist to it. 
In ChessMate you will play a regular round of chess until the cards come into play.
Currently, our plan is to include a Carddeck of 25 Cards from which each player can draw. 
These cards can significantly alter the gameplay. Some will have a minor effect and some will change the rules of chess completely!
A player always has 5 cards on his hand. Though you can only play 1 Card per turn, there is plenty of ways to rig the game and drive your oponent into insanity.
For example: Is your king in checkmate ? Well, on of the cards allows your King to swap places with a pawn.
For more details on the Cards please refer to [Detailed info about the Game](#Detailed-Game-Info) down below.

This Game is made by CS Students, created for the purpose of experiencing android development.

  Play this card immediately after your move.


* #### Crusade
  Play this card when you move a bishop without capturing a piece. This bishop immediately moves one more time.
  [i]
  Play this card after your bishop's first move.


* #### Dark Mirror
  On this move, one of your pawns can capture by moving diagonally backward instead of forward.

  [i]

  Remove one of your own pawns from the chessboard, and set it aside. It is now [i]dead,
  and cannot be brought back into play with another card.
  [i]
  Play this card immediately before or after your move.


* #### Abduction
  Your opponent must look away from the board for ten seconds, as you remove any one of his pieces except the king. He then has ten seconds to look at the board and state what     piece you removed and which square it occupied. 
  If he remembers correctly, the piece is put back in its place. If not, it is captured.
  [i]
  Play this card immediately after your move.


* #### Bombard
  On this move, one of your rooks can move in its normal straight line, jump over any piece or one obstruction on the board, and continue in a straight line. 
  The piece or obstruction is not affected by being jumped. At the end of its move, the rook may make a normal capture.
  [i]
  Play this card on your turn, instead of making a regular move.


* #### Coup
  Your king becomes a prince for the remainder of the game. A prince moves like a king but can be captured. Choose one of your pieces, except a rook or a queen, and mark it. 
  This piece keeps its standard move, but is the new king, and your opponent will win if he checkmates it.
  [i]
  Play this card immediately after your move.

  Continuing Effect:
  Until the end of the game.


* #### Confabulation
  Make an otherwise legal move which puts two of your pieces (other than kings) on the same square. They "merge" into a new piece. It can move and capture like either one of       them, and is affected by any card that affects either of them. Move the two pieces together. Confabulated pawns cannot promote.
  [i]
  Play this card on your turn, instead of making a regular move.

  Continuing Effect:
  Until the piece is captured.


* #### Champion
  Any one knight in play becomes a Champion. Place a marker underneath it. Instead of jumping like a knight, to the opposite corner of a 2 by 3 rectangle, a Champion jumps to     the opposite corner of a 3 by 4 rectangle.
  [i]
  Play this card immediately after your move.

  Continuing Effect:
  Until the transformed knight is removed from the board.

  Move one enemy piece to any square it could have occupied at the beginning of the game. The square must be empty or contain one of your pieces. If one of your pieces is in the   square, it is captured.
