  and cannot be brought back into play with another card.
  [i]
  Play this card immediately before or after your move.


* #### Abduction (8)
  Your opponent must look away from the board for ten seconds, as you remove any one of his pieces except the king. He then has ten seconds to look at the board and state what     piece you removed and which square it occupied. 
  If he remembers correctly, the piece is put back in its place. If not, it is captured.
  [i]
  Play this card immediately after your move.


* #### Bombard (8)
  On this move, one of your rooks can move in its normal straight line, jump over any piece or one obstruction on the board, and continue in a straight line. 
  The piece or obstruction is not affected by being jumped. At the end of its move, the rook may make a normal capture.
  [i]
  Play this card on your turn, instead of making a regular move.


* #### Coup (6)
  Your king becomes a prince for the remainder of the game. A prince moves like a king but can be captured. Choose one of your pieces, except a rook or a queen, and mark it. 
  This piece keeps its standard move, but is the new king, and your opponent will win if he checkmates it.
  [i]
  Play this card immediately after your move.

  Continuing Effect:
  Until the end of the game.


* #### Confabulation (5)
  Make an otherwise legal move which puts two of your pieces (other than kings) on the same square. They "merge" into a new piece. It can move and capture like either one of       them, and is affected by any card that affects either of them. Move the two pieces together. Confabulated pawns cannot promote.
  [i]
  Play this card on your turn, instead of making a regular move.

  Continuing Effect:
  Until the piece is captured.


* #### Champion (3)
  Any one knight in play becomes a Champion. Place a marker underneath it. Instead of jumping like a knight, to the opposite corner of a 2 by 3 rectangle, a Champion jumps to     the opposite corner of a 3 by 4 rectangle.
  [i]
  Play this card immediately after your move.

  Continuing Effect:
  Until the transformed knight is removed from the board.
